                Trading businesses are said to be the link between the manufacturers or suppliers and the end customers. They deal in one specific good or a few categories of goods that render benefit to them. The main function in the trading business is the management of logistics and distribution of the goods and products. Traditional ways of managing the sales of these goods are very hectic and tedious. The automation of these processes through ERP software can lead to more efficiency and growth in sales and distribution.
