                The chemical manufacturing ERP process encompasses two main operations: reaction and blending. Our ERP system facilitates both activities efficiently. Recognizing that raw material consumption can vary from standard BOMs, the ERP allows production entries with actual batch quantities defined by the user, comparing them against BOM standards. It calculates key parameters such as yield, handling loss, and costing based on actual raw materials consumed.
