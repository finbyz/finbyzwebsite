              Earnest Money Deposit (EMD) is a financial guarantee required from bidders to show their commitment to a contract or tender process. Usually a percentage of the bid or a fixed amount, the EMD is held by the inviting organization. If a bidder fails to honor the contract, the EMD may be forfeited. A clear understanding of EMD terms is vital for participants in procurement or bidding activities.
