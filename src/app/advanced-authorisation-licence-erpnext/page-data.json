          "Advance Authorisation Scheme (AAS) or Advance License Scheme is a type of duty exemption scheme introduced by the Government of India under the Foreign Trade Policy 2015-2020. Under this scheme, exemption from the payment of import duties is given to raw materials/inputs required for the manufacture of export products i.e., you can import raw materials/inputs at zero customs duty for the production of export products. The purpose of this scheme is to make Indiaâ€™s products competitive in the global market. When duties paid on raw materials are saved, it automatically brings down the cost of the final export product."
