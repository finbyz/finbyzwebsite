              In today’s competitive and technology-driven landscape, Workflow Automation is crucial for streamlining business operations. ERP, or Enterprise Resource Planning, serves as the backbone of this automation, enabling organizations to unify processes and data under one system. ERP connects all functional areas—finance, sales, inventory, HR—on a centralized platform accessible to all stakeholders. It simplifies data management, improves visibility, and supports data-driven decisions through a unified database.
