# Simple Page Generator Documentation

## Overview

The Simple Page Generator allows you to create complete, styled pages by providing only the essential content. No complex configuration, styling, or layout decisions required - just pure content that gets automatically transformed into beautiful, responsive pages.

## How It Works

1. **Provide Simple Content**: Just give us your text, titles, and basic information
2. **Automatic Styling**: The system applies professional styling, animations, and responsive design

## API Usage

### Creating Pages via API

You can also create pages by sending a POST request to `/api/create-page`:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/create-page \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "My Company",
    "description": "Welcome to our website",
    "sections": [
      {
        "type": "hero",
        "title": "Welcome to Our Platform",
        "description": "We help businesses grow with technology",
        "primaryButton": "Get Started"
      }
    ]
  }'
```

### API Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Page created successfully",
  "data": {
    "title": "My Company",
    "description": "Welcome to our website",
    "sectionsCount": 1,
    "sectionTypes": ["hero"]
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Content Guidelines

3. **Include Action Words**: Use verbs in button text ("Get Started", "Learn More")
4. **Add Social Proof**: Include testimonials and ratings when possible

### Icons and Visuals
- Use emojis for simple icons (üåê, üì±, ‚ö°)
- Keep icons relevant to the content
- Don't overuse icons - let them enhance, not distract

## Error Handling

The system includes validation to ensure your content is complete:

```typescript
// Missing required fields will return an error
{
  "error": "Missing required fields: title, description, and sections are required"
}

// Empty sections will be rejected
{
  "error": "At least one section is required"
}
```

## Customization

While the simple page generator focuses on minimal content, you can still customize:

### Adding Images
```typescript
{
  type: "hero",
  title: "Welcome",
  description: "Our platform",
  primaryButton: "Get Started",
  image: "/path/to/your/image.jpg" // Optional hero image
}
```

### Using Icons
```typescript
{
  type: "service",
  title: "Web Development",
  description: "Custom websites",
  icon: "üåê" // Emoji or icon text
}
```

### Optional Fields
Most fields marked with `?` are optional and will be gracefully handled if omitted.

## Performance

- **Fast Loading**: Optimized components with minimal bundle size
- **SEO Friendly**: Proper meta tags and semantic HTML
- **Mobile First**: Responsive design that works on all devices
- **Accessible**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

## Support

For questions or issues with the simple page generator:

1. Check the validation errors in the API response
2. Ensure all required fields are provided
3. Use the example templates as a starting point
4. Test with simple content first, then add complexity

The simple page generator is designed to be as straightforward as possible - just provide your content and let the system handle the rest!
